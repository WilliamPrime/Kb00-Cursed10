Note: despite me putting created as the current date, i have been working on this for a month or so, i just put the date i actually started uploading this to github

so i started working on this RIGHT at the start of infil

# total time : 
(ive also not done it by date, but by day, and removing the gaps...)


# day 1-3    time: 2 hours

trying a few different layouts in keyboard layout editor.
my goals with this were to create a keyboard that met all the following:
- as compact as possible
-   avoid things i dont need like knobs etc
- a fullsize layout but compacted and with additional keys

here are some of the layouts that i started thinking about
  <img width="2171" height="783" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33a36dce-54be-4fac-b97c-20198ead4d4a" />

but ultimately i decided on this layout because i liked the no gaps look and given that im trying to make my keyboard as compact as possible while not loosing keys, this seems like a reallyyy cursed but acceptable solution for that problem.

# day 4 making a schematic on kicad    time: 1h 25min
<img width="1410" height="1134" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90fd78d3-a27a-4ee1-917e-964f6a5579f8" />
this was a little tricky trying to make sure i double and tripple checked that i had all the switches i needed

# day 5 Starting to layout  the pcb    time: 2 hours
this day was truely painful, there is a reason there arent any pictures here

short version of this day is:
- focusing on the pcb
- REALLY FOCUSSING
- forgot to save
- windows black screen of deathed (its not even blue anymore, sad)
- lost this days progress ðŸ˜­


# day 6 starting to layout the pcb part 2 ,  time: 1hour

after having done this task once allready the previous day it made it a lot faster this time as i had allready re learnt and remembered how to do stuff
(add images here)

so this one was a breeze
i also sort of work out what techniques i had to use to get all the correct spacing for the keyboard

# day 7-9 doing all the tracing and finishing the PCB  time: 3hours
there were a lot of traces
it turns a keyboard with a ton of keys has a ton of traces 
(add imgs here)


# day 10 - 14 the CAD  time: 6hours or so
the CAD was a bit of a struggle trying to get a way to mount the pcb while trying to minimise both the height of the keys, and any brims arround the edge of the board



so here is a final render of the full keyboard

ah yeah the last thing to mention
the omission of any firmware
i plan to use POG and kmk to create a firmware
