This was a shortish project where i wanted to make my own keyboard with my own layout.

The reason for wanting to do this was that i have limited desk space so i prefer a smaller more compact keyboard, so as of currently i use a 65% keyboard
however i do miss having a full size num pad and FN keys so i wanted to create a layout, and keyboard that would focus on getting a full key layout but making it more compact
